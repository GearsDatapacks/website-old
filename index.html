            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Gears and I make <a href="https://youtube.com/@GearsDatapacks">Minecraft datapack videos</a>. I've been playing Minecraft for about three years and making datapacks for about one. I've made several datapacks for myself and others, which you can check out <a>here</a>. If you would like to talk to me about datapacks, Minecraft in general or just to hang out, you can join my <a href="https://discord.gg/fmPKDqf9ze">Discord server</a>.</p>

            <h2>Paid Services</h2>
            <p>I also have a paid service where I make specific datapacks for people. If you would like a datapack made for yourself, please contact <span style="color: orange;">gearsOfficial@proton.me</span> and we can have a discussion about pricing, development, etc.</p>

            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Since I learned how to make datapacks, I have made multiple. Most of which are unfinished and still in development. *sigh*
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Below are a list of datapacks that I have completed and are feature complete enough for use:

            <h3>Explosives</h3>
            <p>This was the first datapack I ever made, and it's pretty simple, but I was proud of it at the time. Basically, it's just a bunch of different explosive weapons. You can download the pack <a href="">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Lucky Blocks</h3>
            <p>This is where I started putting a lot more effort into my packs. This pack took me a vey long time to make and to this day I don't understand some of the code in there (even though I wrote it). This pack is also close to my heart, because this was when I started my YouTube channel, my first video being about this very pack. It's also my most popular pack so far. You can download the pack <a href="">here</a>.</p>
