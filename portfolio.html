            <p>Since I learned how to make datapacks, I have made multiple. Most of which are unfinished and still in development. *sigh*
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Below are a list of datapacks that I have completed and are feature complete enough for use:

            <h3>Explosives</h3>
            <p>This was the first datapack I ever made, and it's pretty simple, but I was proud of it at the time. Basically, it's just a bunch of different explosive weapons. You can download the pack <a href="">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Lucky Blocks</h3>
            <p>This is where I started putting a lot more effort into my packs. This pack took me a vey long time to make and to this day I don't understand some of the code in there (even though I wrote it). This pack is also close to my heart, because this was when I started my YouTube channel, my first video being about this very pack. It's also my most popular pack so far. You can download the pack <a href="">here</a>.</p>
